							<h3 style="color:white;">ES2C0:Analogue Electronic Design</h3>
							<p style="color:white;"> This module builds upon existing knowledge of electronics from first year, it covered linear devices, active/passive filters, voltage regulation and signal conversion.</p>

              <hr>

              <h3 style="color:white;">ES2C4:Computer Architecture and Systems</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">The aim of this modules was to provide practical knowledge of how digital computing systems are designed, how they function and how to program them. Through this module, I was able to further my skills in C and Assembly language. The module was assessed through a design project and examination. These assignments covered data representation, logic and digital arithmetic, instruction set architecture (assembly language, machine instructions), processor microarchitecture (memory, ALU, program counter, register file, control unit, single-cycle and pipelined processors) and microcontroller programming.</p>

              <hr>

               <h3 style="color:white;">ES2C5:Dynamics and Fluid Mechanics</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">The main goal of this module was to develop a firm understanding of mechanical concepts from first year. The dynamics section of this module focused on the principles of work and energy as well as the analysis of rigid-body motion and standard mechanisms. I also learnt about step and frequency response of second order systems. This study was then supported with appropriate laboratory exercises. The fluid mechanics side of the module covered concepts such as viscosity, laminar and turbulent flow and Bernoulli's equation.</p>

              <hr>

               <h3 style="color:white;">ES2C6:Electromechanical System Design</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">In this modules I developed a deeper understanding of electrical power generation, transmission, distributon and consumption and of how integrated engineering systems with energy conversion stages operate. Through this module I also was able to understand the underpinning science behind energy conversion in electromechanical systems. This module was assessed through an examination and design project. The design project involved designing and producing a robotic gripper arm (designed in Fusion 360), 3D printed with then electrical components added after. The purpose of the gripper was for it to be able to detect a nearby object's presence and apply the appropriate amount of force to pick it up with damaging it.  </p>

              <hr>
               <h3 style="color:white;">ES2C7:Engineering Mathematics and Data Analytics</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">Building upon what was covered in Engineering Mathematics and Systems Modelling, Simulation and Computation from the previous year, this module further developed my mathematical and programming skills and provided me with the tools needed to develop complex mathematicals models of engineering systems and solve complex engineering problems using MATLAB. This module was assesed through as series MATLAB based assessments and a final mathematical examination which covered topics such as the taylor series, fourier series, applied linear algebra, z-transforms and partial differential equations.</p>

              <hr>
               <h3 style="color:white;">ES2D3:Motor Vehicle Technology</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">This module provided me with an insight into how motor vehicles functioned, it covered areas such as transmission systems, gearbox and gear ratios, drive systems. It was assessed through two different research projects.</p>

              <hr>
               <h3 style="color:white;">ES2D7:Systems and Software Engineering Principles</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">This module gave me a greater insight into software engineering and it can be used to solve engineering problems. The main focus being on equipping me with the skills needed to be successful software engineer, covering concepts such the difference between verification and validation and how to apply object-orientated techniques for solving programming problems. This module was assessed through coursework, the main project being the educational game created in MATLAB which in listed in the projects sections of this portfolio.</p>

              <hr>
               <h3 style="color:white;">ES2D8:Technical Operations Management</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">This module provided me with the ability to demonstrate how engineering businesses can meet the challenges created by the dynamic industrial and commercial environment in which they operate. Covering topics such as supply networks, organisational structure and quality management, it was building upon what had been covered in the engineering business management module from the previous year. This module was assessed through several written assignments demonstrating our understanding of the content and how to apply that in our further research.</p>
