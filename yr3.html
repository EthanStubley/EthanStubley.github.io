							<h3 style="color:white;">ES327: Individual Project</h3>
							<p style="color:white;"><a style="color:white;" href="FYP.html">(See Final Year Project)</a> This was the main project for my final year, it was a computational and research based project, where I had to keep detailed notes in a logbook and consider risk management and project planning in order to complete my work within the time frame given.</p>

              <hr>

              <h3 style="color:white;">ES372: Automation and Robotics</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">This module provided me with an understanding of the principles of operation for automated equipment, with particular reference to industrial robots. It focused on the knowledge needed to select and use such equipment effectively and safely, there was also an emphasis on the use of sensors to make robots behave "intelligently". I was assesed through some practical lab excercises and an exam.</p>

              <hr>

               <h3 style="color:white;">ES386: Dynamics of Vibrating Systems</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">In this module, I was provided with the fundamental skills necessary for the analysis of the dynamics of mechanical systems as well as the application of these skills to the modelling and analysis of vibration. Some of the topics covered were Lagrange's equation, multi-degree of freedom systems and matrix methods of analysis.</p>

              <hr>

               <h3 style="color:white;">ES3C5: Signal Processing</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">This module gave me skills to be able to select and apply appropriate mathematical models for modelling and analysing signals as well as understanding the scientific principles underlying the generation of signals. This module assessed my practical skills through laboratory sessions as well as a written examination. It took alot of mathematical concepts introduced in previous modules and gave them real-world applications. The modules covered concepts such as signals, filter design, quantisation and random signal analysis.</p>

              <hr>
               <h3 style="color:white;">ES3C8: Systems Modelling and Control</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">Building upon systems modelling concepts from previous modules, this module built upon techniques and computer tools for modelling, predicting and analyising the behaviour of systems. I furthered my knowledge in systems modelling and analysis in the time domain and complex frequency domain and in frequency domain analysis as well. Additionally I also studied at systems control and feedback loops. I also utilized computational methods in MATLAB and SIMULINK to apply concepts and techniques for analysis of behaviour of various open loop physical systems and designing feedback control systems</p>

              <hr>
               <h3 style="color:white;">ES3H3: Intelligent Systems Design</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">In this module I learnt how to perform end-to-end development of a machine learning system and applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems, as well as this I also applied computer vision techniques for solving problems such as face recognition and motion estimation. This module also covered concepts such as model fitting techniques, classification and neural networks.</p>

              <hr>
               <h3 style="color:white;">ES3J1: Advanced Systems and Software Engineering</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">This module covered the appropriate skills and topics to equip me with the practical and theoretical knowledge to develop complex programs within industry, including the use of open-source development tools and libraries (i.e. python), deriving data-driven models of a system and implementing a real-time control system. The software development work was majoritively completed in python, covering areas such as functions and classes, development of GUIs and application of machine learning and system analysis techniques.</p>
