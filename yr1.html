							<h3 style="color:white;">ES101: Introduction to Engineering: Professionalism and Practice</h3>
							<p style="color:white;"> An Introduction to Engineering, which covered: </p>
							<ul>
  								<li style="color:white;">Engineering Ethics</li>
  								<li style="color:white;">Health and Safety</li>
  								<li style="color:white;">Basic skills (IT; note taking & research; Writing & Presentation; Study skills; Time Management)</li>
							</ul>  

              <hr>

              <h3 style="color:white;">ES190: Dynamics and Thermodynamics</h3>
							<p style="color:white;"> This module was spilt into two sections, dynamics & thermodynamics. In dynamics, I covered fundamental laws, kinetics, kinematics & dynamic analysis. In thermodynamics, I covered energy storage & working fluids, heat transfer, thermodynamic laws and the Carnot cycle. I was assessed through laboratory exercises and an examination.</p>

              <hr>

               <h3 style="color:white;">ES191: Electrical and Electronic Circuits</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">Introductory module to electronics, covering: </p>
							<ul style="color:white;">
  								<li style="color:white;">DC & AC circuit analysis</li>
  								<li style="color:white;">Magnetism</li>
  								<li style="color:white;">Diodes</li>
								<li style="color:white;">Transistors</li>
								<li style="color:white;">Operational amplifiers</li>
								<li style="color:white;">Analogue amplifiers and circuits</li>
								<li style="color:white;">Digital Electronics</li>
								<li style="color:white;">Active and passive filters</li>
							</ul> 

							<p style="color:white;">This module was assessed through an examination and several laboratory exercises.</p>
							<hr>

               <h3 style="color:white;">ES192: Engineering Design</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">This module helped develop my design skills through the coursework, which was a design portfolio to be completed throughout the course of the module, and then being submitted at the end. I covered the generic design process, engineering theory and building prototypes. This was achieved through collaborative projects as well as some individual designs as well. Alot of work was done in Autodesk's Fusion 360, using CAD to produce and develop design ideas.</p>

              <hr>
               <h3 style="color:white;">ES193: Engineering Mathematics</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">This module applied mathematical tools and techniques to solve engineering based problems and covered topics such as vector algebra, matrix algebra, complex numbers, partial differentiation, laplace transforms and probability theory. </p>

              <hr>
               <h3 style="color:white;">ES194: Introduction to Engineering Business Management</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">In this module, I covered the basics of business organisation within engineering corporations. Covering things like economies, markets and infrastructure. It helped me appreciate the impact of economic factors on the competitive performance of a business and evaluate the positioning of a business within its market and economic environment. This module was assessed through an examination and company analysis report.</p>

              <hr>
               <h3 style="color:white;">ES195: Materials for Engineering</h3>
							<p style="color:white;"> This module introduced materials science with the goal of understanding the properties and applications of the main classes of engineering materials. I covered the 4 main classes of materials, their molecular and atomic structure, enivronmental and sustainability considerations as well as the selection of appropriate materials and manufacturing processes.</p>

              <hr>
               <h3 style="color:white;">ES196: Statics and Structures</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">The aim of this module was to build fundamental knowledge of statics and behaviour of structures that underpin many branches of engineering science. It provided me with knowledge relating to the design and analysis of structures and helped increase my ability with mathematical analysis and in particular the application to sloving problems in structures.</p>

              <hr>
               <h3 style="color:white;">ES197: Systems Modelling, Simulation and Computation</h3>
							<p style="color:white;">Through this module I developed my skills in applying computational thinking to create software for solving modelling and simualtion problems. I also practiced creating and designing models developed with a user and purpose in mind. I covered key programming concepts, systems modelling (translational, rotational, electrical & thermal), first and second order systems. This module was assessed through a submittable project and an assessment relating to the content covered.</p>
